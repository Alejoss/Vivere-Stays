# MSP Notification Implementation Summary

## ‚úÖ What Was Implemented

I've created a complete MSP (Minimum Selling Price) notification system that automatically detects when MSP is missing and notifies users.

---

## üìÅ Files Created

1. **`backend/dynamic_pricing/notification_triggers.py`**
   - Core notification logic
   - Functions to check MSP for today, next week, and custom date ranges
   - Automatic notification creation with smart deduplication

2. **`backend/dynamic_pricing/management/commands/check_msp_notifications.py`**
   - Django management command
   - Can be run manually or via cron job
   - Supports checking specific users, properties, or all users

3. **`backend/dynamic_pricing/MSP_NOTIFICATIONS_README.md`**
   - Complete documentation
   - API reference, integration examples, troubleshooting

4. **`MSP_NOTIFICATION_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** (this file)
   - Quick start guide

---

## üìù Files Modified

1. **`backend/dynamic_pricing/views.py`**
   - Added `CheckMSPStatusView` - New API endpoint to check MSP status
   - Modified `PropertyMSPView.post()` - Auto-checks MSP after user creates/updates MSP

2. **`backend/dynamic_pricing/urls.py`**
   - Added two new URL routes for MSP checking

---

## üöÄ Quick Start

### 1. Run Migrations

The notification system uses the `Notification` model from profiles app:

```bash
cd backend
python manage.py makemigrations profiles
python manage.py migrate
```

### 2. Test the System

#### Option A: Via API (Recommended)

```bash
# Check MSP for all user properties
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/dynamic-pricing/check-msp/' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

# Check MSP for specific property
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/dynamic-pricing/properties/{property_id}/check-msp/' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
```

#### Option B: Via Management Command

```bash
# Check all users
python manage.py check_msp_notifications --all-users

# Check specific user
python manage.py check_msp_notifications --user-id 1

# Check specific property
python manage.py check_msp_notifications --property-id abc-123
```

### 3. View Created Notifications

```bash
# Via API
curl -X GET 'http://localhost:8000/api/profiles/notifications/' \
  -H 'Authorization: Bearer YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'

# Via Django Admin
# Go to: http://localhost:8000/admin/profiles/notification/
```

## üìä How It Works

### Automatic Triggering

The system **automatically** creates notifications in these scenarios:

1. **After MSP Update** ‚úÖ Already integrated
   - When user creates/updates MSP via API
   - System checks if dates are now covered

2. **Manual Check** ‚úÖ Ready to use
   - User calls `/api/dynamic-pricing/properties/{id}/check-msp/`
   - Frontend can call this on dashboard load

3. **Scheduled Task** ‚úÖ Ready to configure
   - Run via cron job daily
   - Use: `python manage.py check_msp_notifications --all-users`

### Notification Types

#### 1. MSP Missing for Today
- **Priority**: High
- **Type**: Warning
- **Title**: "MSP not configured for today"
- **Description**: "You don't have a Minimum Selling Price (MSP) configured for today (October 8, 2024). Set it up now to ensure proper pricing."

#### 2. MSP Missing for Next Week
- **Priority**: Medium
- **Type**: Warning
- **Title**: "MSP not configured for next week"
- **Description**: "You don't have a Minimum Selling Price (MSP) configured for next week (Oct 09 - Oct 15, 2024). We recommend setting it up to optimize your revenue."

### Smart Features

- ‚úÖ **No Duplicates**: Won't create notification if one was sent in last 24 hours
- ‚úÖ **Action URLs**: Each notification has a direct link to fix the issue
- ‚úÖ **Metadata**: Rich data about missing dates, property info
- ‚úÖ **Coverage Stats**: Shows 30-day MSP coverage percentage

## üîó Integration Points

### Option 1: Check on Dashboard Load (Recommended)

In your frontend dashboard component:

```typescript
import { checkMSPStatus } from '@/api/dynamic-pricing';

async function onDashboardLoad() {
  try {
    // Check MSP for current property
    const result = await checkMSPStatus(propertyId);
    
    if (result.notifications_created.length > 0) {
      // Refresh notifications in UI
      refreshNotifications();
    }
    
    // Show coverage stats
    console.log(`MSP Coverage: ${result.coverage_stats.coverage_percentage}%`);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('MSP check failed:', error);
  }
}
```

### Option 2: Scheduled Cron Job (Recommended)

Add to your crontab to run daily at 9 AM:

```cron
# Check MSP notifications daily at 9:00 AM
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/backend && python manage.py check_msp_notifications --all-users >> /var/log/msp_notifications.log 2>&1
```

### Option 3: Check After Property Creation

Already integrated! When user creates/updates MSP entries, the system automatically checks.

## üéØ Next Steps

### Immediate (Already Working)

1. ‚úÖ **Run migrations** to create Notification table
2. ‚úÖ **Test with a property** that has no MSP
3. ‚úÖ **View notifications** in Django admin or via API

### Short-term (Easy to Add)

1. **Frontend Integration**
   - Call `/check-msp/` endpoint on dashboard load
   - Display notifications in your existing Notifications component
   - Show MSP coverage percentage in dashboard

2. **Scheduled Task**
   - Set up cron job to run daily
   - Monitor logs for any issues

### Long-term (Future Enhancements)

1. **Email Notifications**
   - Send email when high-priority notifications are created
   - Use your existing email service

2. **More Notification Types**
   - No competitors configured
   - PMS disconnected
   - Price history gaps
   - Competitor price changes

3. **Auto-dismiss**
   - Automatically mark notifications as read when user fixes the issue

---

## üîß Configuration

### Change Deduplication Window

In `backend/dynamic_pricing/notification_triggers.py`:

```python
# Current: 24 hours
recent_notification = Notification.objects.filter(
    # ...
    created_at__gte=timezone.now() - timedelta(hours=24)  # Change this
).exists()
```

### Change Notification Priority

In the same file, modify:

```python
notification = create_notification(
    user=user,
    notification_type='warning',  # success, warning, info, error
    priority='high',              # low, medium, high, urgent
    # ...
)
```

### Change Check Period

For "next week", currently checks next 7 days. To change:

```python
def check_msp_configured_next_week(property_obj):
    today = timezone.now().date()
    next_week_start = today + timedelta(days=1)
    next_week_end = today + timedelta(days=7)  # Change this to 14, 30, etc.
    # ...
```

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Notifications Not Appearing?

1. **Check if MSP exists**:
   ```python
   from dynamic_pricing.models import DpMinimumSellingPrice
   from datetime import date
   
   today = date.today()
   DpMinimumSellingPrice.objects.filter(
       property_id=your_property,
       valid_from__lte=today,
       valid_until__gte=today
   )
   ```

2. **Check for recent notifications**:
   ```python
   from profiles.models import Notification
   
   Notification.objects.filter(
       user=your_user,
       category='pricing'
   ).order_by('-created_at')[:5]
   ```

3. **Check logs**:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/django.log | grep "MSP"
   ```

### Too Many Notifications?

- Notifications are deduplicated (24-hour window)
- If still too many, increase the deduplication window

2. **Notification Triggers** - Functions that check conditions and create notifications
3. **Smart Deduplication** - Prevents spam by checking for recent duplicates
4. **Auto-integration** - MSP checks happen automatically after updates
5. **Coverage Stats** - Provides visibility into MSP configuration completeness

---

## üö¶ Status

‚úÖ **Backend**: Fully implemented and ready to use
‚è≥ **Frontend**: Ready for integration (API endpoints available)
‚è≥ **Scheduled Tasks**: Ready to configure (cron job template provided)

---

## üí° Example Workflow

1. User logs in ‚Üí Dashboard loads ‚Üí `/check-msp/` called
2. System checks: "Does property have MSP for today?"
3. System checks: "Does property have MSP for next 7 days?"
4. If missing: Creates notification with action URL
5. User sees notification in notification center
6. User clicks "Set up MSP" ‚Üí Goes to MSP page
7. User adds MSP ‚Üí System checks again ‚Üí No new notification created
